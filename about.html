					<h1> About EveryUse </h1>
					<p>
						EveryUse is the new platform particularly designed for sharing cases of artifact appropriation.
						However, EveryUse not only involves sharing and viewing; it also includes other activities,
						such as commenting and "scrapping" (saving or bookmarking) others' cases, and "following"
						other participants. EveryUse is developed as an Android application, to run on an
						Android device with an OS version higher than 2.3.3 (Gingerbread), so that people could
						download EveryUse from Google Play and install it on an Android-based mobile phone.
					</p>
					<h2> Sharing cases of appropriation </h2>
					<p>
						EveryUse enables people to describe an item they used and the purpose for which they
						used it and upload a picture of the case of appropriation. Limiting the description of purpose
						enables the platform to form categories of purpose by simplifying its expression and diminishes
						people's efforts to describe it.
					</p>
					<h2> Viewing others' cases </h2>
					<p>
						EveryUse supports viewing others' cases in five tabs: Top, Recent, Feed, Category, and My
						use. In the list of Top, the highly ranked cases are shown according to two comments: Wow
						and Me-too. You can view the most admired cases and the most sympathized with cases in
						the Top view. Shared cases are also listed in chronological order on the Recent tab. You can
						check newly uploaded cases as well as expose your own case to other participants after uploading.
						The cases that are uploaded by followees ("followee" refers to someone whom the
						user is following) are listed in chronological order in the list of Feed. The Category view displays
						the categories of items and purposes grouping identical expressions of items and purposes.
						The categories are sorted alphabetically by item and purpose. The Category view
						also supports a search function through which you can search for a certain item or purpose.
						In My use, you can view the cases you shared and those on which you commented or
						scrapped.
